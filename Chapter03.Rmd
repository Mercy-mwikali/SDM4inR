## Introduction and background 

This document is intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Fourth Edition of \emph{Stats: Data and Models} (2014) by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock.
More information about the book can be found at http://wps.aw.com/aw_deveaux_stats_series.  This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).

## Chapter 3: Displaying and describing quantitative data

### Section 3.1: Displaying quantitative variables

See Figure 3.1 on page 46.
```{r}
library(mosaic); library(readr)
options(digits=3)
Tsunami <- read_delim("http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4/data/Tsunami_Earthquakes.txt", delim="\t")
nrow(Tsunami)   
histogram(~ Magnitude, width=0.5, center=0.25, data=Tsunami)
```

See display on page 48.

```{r}
Pulse_rates <- read_delim("http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4/data/Pulse_rates.txt", delim="\t")
with(Pulse_rates, stem(Pulse))  # data don't exactly match
dotPlot(~ Pulse, data=Pulse_rates)
```

### Section 3.2: Shape


### Section 3.3: Center

See calculation on page 53.
```{r}
recent <- filter(Tsunami, Year >= 1989, Year <= 2013)
nrow(recent)   
median(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
```


### Section 3.4: Spread

See statistics reported on pages 54-55.

```{r}
favstats(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
range(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
diff(range(~ Magnitude, data=recent))
IQR(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
```

### Section 3.5: Boxplots and 5-Number Summaries

See display on page 57.
```{r}
bwplot(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
```

### Section 3.6: The Center of Symmetric Distributions: The Mean

See calculation on page 59.

```{r}
mean(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
median(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
```

### Section 3.7: The Spread of Symmetric Distributions: The Standard Deviation


```{r}
sd(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
var(~ Magnitude, data=recent)
sqrt(var(~ Magnitude, data=recent))
```
