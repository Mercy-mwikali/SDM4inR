This\nfile as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4.\n\nThis work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).\n\n## Chapter 10: Understanding Randomness\n\n### Section 10.1: What is Randomness? \n\n### Section 10.2: Simulating by Hand\n\nShown below is the box and whisker plot from page 284.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(mosaic); library(readr)\ndata <- c(5,4,7,5,18,6,5,4,6) \ndata$ID <- seq.int(nrow(data))\n\nbwplot(~data, data=data)\n```\n",
