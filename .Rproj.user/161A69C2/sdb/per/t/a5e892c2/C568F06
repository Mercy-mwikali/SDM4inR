This\nfile as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4.\n\nThis work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).\n\n## Chapter 9: Re-expressing Data: Get it Straight!\n\n### Section 9.1: Straightening Scatterplots - The Four Goals\n\n### Section 9.2: Finding a Good Re-expression\n\n\n",
