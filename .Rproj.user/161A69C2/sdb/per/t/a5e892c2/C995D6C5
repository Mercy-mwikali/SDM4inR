This\nfile as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4.\n\nThis work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).\n\n## Chapter 20: Inferences about Means\n\n### Section 20.1: The Central Limit Theorem\n\nLet's begin by reproducing the figure on the bottom of page 519.\n\n```{r}\nmu <- 1309\nsd <- 15.7\nxpnorm(c(mu-3*sd, mu-2*sd, mu-sd, mu+sd, mu+2*sd, mu+3*sd), mean=mu, sd=sd)\n```\n\n### Section 20.2: Gosset's t\n\nFigure 20.1 (page 521) displays a normal curve (dashed green curve) and a t-model with 2 degrees of freedom (solid blue curve).\n\n```{r fig.keep=\"last\"}\nplotDist(\"norm\", lty=2, col=\"green\", lwd=2)\nplotDist(\"t\", params=2, lty=1, lwd=2, col=\"blue\", add=TRUE)\n```\n\nWe can reproduce the calculations for the Farmed salmon example (pages 523-524) using summary statistics:\n\n```{r}\nn <- 150; ybar <- 0.0913; s = 0.0495\ntstar <- qt(0.975, df=n-1); tstar\nybar + c(-tstar, tstar)*s/sqrt(n)\n```\n\nor directly:\n\n```{r}\nSalmon <- read.csv(\"http://www.amherst.edu/~nhorton/sdm4/data/Farmed_Salmon.csv\")\nfavstats(~ Mirex, data=Salmon)\nhistogram(~ Mirex, width=0.01, center=0.01/2, data=Salmon)\nt.test(~ Mirex, data=Salmon)\n```\n\nWe note that the distribution of measurements is not particularly normal.\n\n#### Section 20.4: A hypothesis test for the mean\n\nWe can carry out the one-sided test outlined on page 530:\n\n```{r}\ntval <- (.0913-0.08)/0.0040; tval\n1-xpt(tval, df=149)\n```\n\n\n",
