## Introduction and background 

This document is intended to help describe how to undertake analyses introduced 
as examples in the Fourth Edition of \emph{Stats: Data and Models} (2014) by De Veaux, Velleman, and Bock.
More information about the book can be found at http://wps.aw.com/aw_deveaux_stats_series.  This
file as well as the associated R Markdown reproducible analysis source file used to create it can be found at http://nhorton.people.amherst.edu/sdm4.

This work leverages initiatives undertaken by Project MOSAIC (http://www.mosaic-web.org), an NSF-funded effort to improve the teaching of statistics, calculus, science and computing in the undergraduate curriculum. In particular, we utilize the `mosaic` package, which was written to simplify the use of R for introductory statistics courses. A short summary of the R needed to teach introductory statistics can be found in the mosaic package vignettes (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic).
A paper describing the mosaic approach was published in the *R Journal*: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-024.

## Chapter 19: Testing hypotheses for proportions

### Section 19.1: Hypotheses

We can reproduce the calculation in Figure 19.1 (page 495).

```{r}
sdp <- sqrt(.2*.8/400)
sdp
xpnorm(0.17, mean = 0.20, sd = sdp)
zval <- (0.17 - 0.20)/sdp
zval
pnorm(zval, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

### Section 19.3: Reasoning of hypothesis testing

The "For Example (page 499)" lays out how to find a p-value for the one proportion z-test.

```{r}
y <- 61 
n <- 90 
phat <- y/n
phat
nullp <- 0.8
sdp <- sqrt(nullp*(1-nullp)/n)
sdp
onesidep <- xpnorm(phat, mean = nullp, sd = sdp)
onesidep
twosidep <- 2*onesidep
twosidep
```

or we can carry out the exact test (not described by the book):

```{r}
binom.test(y, n, p = nullp)
```
